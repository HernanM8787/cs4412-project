_Description:_
This proposal marks the first Milestone for the CS4412 Data Mining project. This project will answer 2 Discovery Questions. 
**_"Which products are most often bought together in a
single transaction?"_**
**_"How does a customer’s country impact their product
preferences?"_**
These questions will investigate consumer behavior within the chosen dataset. This will be done by applying Association Rule Mining and K-Means Clustering.
